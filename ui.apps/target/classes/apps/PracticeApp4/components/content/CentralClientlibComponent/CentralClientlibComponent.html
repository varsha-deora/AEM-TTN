<!--adding central clientlib in the page instead of componnet-->

➤Unified Approach: This is also called as centralised approach.In this approach, we will create a global clientlibs in “/etc/clientlibs” and it just need to included it in our base page.

Pros: If the project is so small, then we can go with the Unified approach.
Cons:This approach is having a centralized clientlibs.So It is very difficult to manage and debug large clientlibs.
