➤ Modular Approach:
In this approach, we will create a global clientlibs in “/etc/clientlibs” and create some component level clientlibs. These  component level clientlibs should be embedded in global clientlibs.
Pros:
Very maintained and managed clientlibs.
Easy to debug.
Number of network calls will be very less.

Cons:
If there is a component level clientlibs, and the component is not dragged on a page, still the clientlibs will get loaded. It will degrade the performance of the page.
We can’t directly include the clientlibs written in /apps on the page as on publish, anonymous user restrict /apps folder.

A component level client lib [ModularClientlibComponent] is embeded in global clientlib [PracticeApp4.modula] which is included in basepage
