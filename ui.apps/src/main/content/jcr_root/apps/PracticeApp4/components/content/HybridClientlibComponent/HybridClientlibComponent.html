➤ Hybrid Approach:

This is something new which AEM 6.3 provides.
There is a concept of “proxy servlet”, with the help of this we can directly include the clientlibs(present under “/apps”) on a page.
[This feature also works perfectly fine with AEM 6.2 with SP1 CFP13 Service/Feature Pack]

In order to better isolate code from content and configuration, it is recommended to locate client libraries under /apps and expose them via /etc.clientlibs by leveraging the allowProxy property.
Note: Don’t forgot to change the dispatcher configuration for /etc.clientlibs.

Pros:
Hybrid approach overcomes the problem of modular approach of not including /apps clientlibs directly on any page by using proxy Servlet.

Cons:
The network calls may be high,if you include component level clientlibs on component’s html.
